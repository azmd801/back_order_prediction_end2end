# back_order_prediction_end2end
This repo contains an end-to-end solution for predicting product back-orders using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation tools, designed to help businesses mitigate supply chain disruptions


### Problem Statement

*Backorders* are a pervasive issue in the retail and supply chain sectors, causing unexpected strains on production, logistics, and transportation. The analysis aims to construct a predictive model that can forecast backorders based on past data from inventories, supply chain, and sales, thereby aiding in streamlined planning and prevention of unforeseen operational strains. 

This is a Binary Classification problem,the goal is to classify products as going into backorder (Yes or No), utilizing the vast amount of data generated by ERP systems, which contains a wealth of historical data that can be harnessed for this purpose.

### Solution Proposed 

The project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of products going into backorder. Historical data that encompasses inventory levels, supply chain dynamics, sales patterns, and pertinent factors will be utilized.

This is a Binary Classification Problem hence consists of two target values :

* Yes: Represents that product will go to backorder.  
* No: Represents that product will not go to backorder

For this problem Accurately predicting both classes is essential.False positives can result in excess costs and resource allocation. On the other hand, false negativesâ€”products can lead to missed opportunities and customer dissatisfaction

## Tech Stack Used

1. Python 
2. FastAPI 
3. Machine learning algorithms
4. Docker
5. MongoDB

## Infrastructure Required.

1. AWS S3
2. AWS EC2
3. AWS ECR
4. Git Actions

## How to run?

Before we run the project, make sure that you are having MongoDB in your local system, with Compass since we are using MongoDB for data storage. You also need AWS account to access the service like S3, ECR and EC2 instances.

for setting up AWS services

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sethusaim/Sensor-Fault-Detection.git
```

### Step 2- Create a conda environment after opening the repository

```bash
conda create -n sensor python=3.7.6 -y
```

```bash
conda activate sensor
```

### Step 3 - Install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4 - Export the environment variable

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>

export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<AWS_DEFAULT_REGION>

export MONGODB_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@ineuron-ai-projects.7eh1w4s.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

```

### Step 5 - Run the application server

```bash
python app.py
```

### Step 6. Train application

```bash
http://localhost:8080/train

```

### Step 7. Prediction application

```bash
http://localhost:8080/predict

```

## Run locally

1. Check if the Dockerfile is available in the project directory

2. Build the Docker image

```
docker build -t sensor . 

```

3. Run the Docker image

```
docker run -d -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}" -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}" -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="${{ secrets.AWS_DEFAULT_REGION }}" -e MONGODB_URL="${{ secrets.MONGODB_URL }}" -p 8080:8080 sensor
```
